A multithreaded implementation of HTM in ISO standard C, designed to explicitly AVOID as many programming abstractions as possible.
  - minimal loop complexity
  - minimal conditional jumps/execution branches
  - minimal function calls, especially in loops, rather favoring macros and inlined code
  - efficient use of cpu L2i/L2d cache, consciously try for hits
  - minimal GNU extensions, unless perf gains greatly outweigh portability benefit

Libraries and APIs:
libxml2
pthreads
